# Overview

This is a recipe organization program using Kotlin that allows a user to create, view, and search recipes.

I wrote this program to learn more about the Kotlin language, which I had never used prior, as well as using an IDE that is not Visual Studio. I also wanted to experiment with search functions, as they are new territory for me.

Here's a link to a YouTube demonstration of the code:

# Development Environment

- Intellij IDEA IDE
- Kotlin language with imported File class from Java

# Useful Websites

Here are a few websites I found useful in the development of this project:

- [OFficial Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [W3Schools Kotlin Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/KOTLIN/index.php)

# Future Work

Some things I'd like to add in the future:

- Recipe editing
- Tell where search term matched in a recipe
- Multiple simultaneous search terms
